# sqlalchemy-challenge

The goal of this challenge was to use SQLAlchemy coding in order to analyze weather data gathered from 9 weather stations located at different places around the Hawaiian islands. I had to use both Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code to complete the analysis for this challenge. I also got to use Flask for the first time through Visual Studion to create and display the data on a website. Descriptions and analysis are included within the Jupyter Notebook. I started but was unable to finish the Bonus Challenge activities in time for the due date but will continue to work on them and resubmit the work once completed. 

Files included in this challenge: hawaii.sqlite, hawaii_meaurements.csv, hawaii_stations.csv

Dependencies used: sqlalchemy, matplotlib, scipy, numpy, pandas, datetime, flask

My main takeaway from this project is that SQLAlchemy is a powerful and useful tool for analyzing multiple data files. It was exciting learning how to use Flask coding in order to create the API to present my data on an actual website as well as I had not ever used or seen this type of programming before.

The most difficult challenge I had with this assignment was getting my data to display correctly on the webpage using Flask and I also didn't give myself enough time to really look into and complete the bonus challenges. 

I was unable to finish the bonus part of the homework. I will continue working on the bonus as I want to understand how to combine and display the data properly using graphs.

Overall, I found this homework challenge to be quite a bit more difficult than previous challenges up to this point. I am looking forward to more challenges like this one to push my knowledge and understanding.
